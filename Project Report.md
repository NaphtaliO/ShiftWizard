# Background

Work rostering the human resources of a business is more than merely recording each employees working hours. Rostering, when done correctly can be essential for planning how employees work within a firm.
A well planned roster can have an impact on five key areas in a business; employee motivation, performance tracking, attendance, workplace health and safety and productivity levels. 
It is all well and good having qualified staff but if they are unhappy because of the times they are working this can affect their performance. Jobs will be left undone, and attendance will be low. Using a rostering system can help find the specific time of day where each employee works best. When the human resources of a firm are managed fairly and efficiently, employees are far more motivated and productivity levels are met.
